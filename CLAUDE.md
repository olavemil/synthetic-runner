# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Symbiosis toolkit** — a framework for building multi-layered LLM agent systems. The implementation is complete and tested.

Key documents:
- `docs/architecture.md` — Three-layer architecture specification
- `docs/implementation.md` — Technical implementation roadmap
- `proposals/neural_nets/` — Hybrid NN/LLM extension proposals (architecture + memory tools)

## Commands

```bash
uv run pytest                  # run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_X.py  # run specific test file
uv run symbiosis check         # poll adapters, enqueue jobs (lightweight)
uv run symbiosis work          # drain job queue run-to-empty
uv run symbiosis tick          # check + work (one cycle, for testing)
uv run symbiosis schedule      # print OS scheduler config files
uv run symbiosis setup         # interactive setup wizard
uv run symbiosis run           # legacy continuous loop
```

## Architecture

Three layers with strict separation:

- **Harness** (`library/harness/`) — Infrastructure: config, storage, SQLite store, LLM providers, messaging adapters, job queue, checker, worker, scheduler.
- **Species** (`library/species/`) — Stateless behavior. Exports a `SpeciesManifest` with `entry_points`, `tools`, `default_files`, `spawn`. Handlers take `(ctx: InstanceContext, ...)`.
- **Instance** — Pure data: a YAML config + namespaced file storage. No code.

**InstanceContext** is the only interface between Species and Harness:
- `ctx.read/write/list/exists` — namespaced file storage
- `ctx.read_binary/write_binary` — binary file storage (PyTorch checkpoints, etc.)
- `ctx.llm(messages, ...)` → `LLMResponse`
- `ctx.send/poll(space, ...)` — messaging via logical space names
- `ctx.send_to/read_inbox` — inter-instance mailboxes
- `ctx.store/shared_store(namespace)` → `NamespacedStore` (SQLite)
- `ctx.get_space_context(space)` — room metadata
- `ctx.list_spaces()` — available logical space names

**Species never** import vendor SDKs, construct absolute paths, or call HTTP directly.

## Scheduling Architecture

The preferred deployment model uses OS scheduling (`launchd`/`systemd`/`cron`) to run two short-lived commands:

- **`check`** (every ~5 min): polls messaging adapters + checks cron schedules → enqueues jobs into SQLite queue. No LLM calls.
- **`work`** (every ~1 min): drains job queue run-to-empty using threads. Respects provider concurrency limits.

State is persisted in SQLite (`harness.db`):
- Sync tokens per instance/space
- Schedule next-fire times
- Idle heartbeat counts (`max_idle_heartbeats` in instance YAML throttles heartbeats when no messages)
- Job queue with instance guards (prevents duplicate concurrent jobs per instance)
- Provider slots for concurrency control (`max_concurrency` in harness.yaml)

Generate OS schedule files with `symbiosis schedule` (reads `scheduler.check_interval` / `scheduler.work_interval` from `harness.yaml`).

## Config Structure

```
config/
  harness.yaml          # providers (with max_concurrency), adapters, scheduler settings
  instances/
    <id>.yaml           # species, provider, model, messaging (with access_token), schedule
.env                    # secrets: API keys, Matrix tokens
```

- `config/instances/example.yaml` is committed; real instance configs are gitignored.
- Per-instance Matrix `access_token` lives in instance YAML (not shared adapter config).
- `schedule.max_idle_heartbeats: N` limits heartbeat runs when no messages received.

## Neural Net Extension

Spec: `proposals/neural_nets/architecture-technical.md` + `proposals/neural_nets/tools-memory-representations.md`

Adds a dual neural network layer and non-textual memory tools on top of the existing pipeline architecture. All new code is **tools modules** (opt-in by species), with one small harness addition (`read_binary`/`write_binary`).

### Key design decisions

- **Tools not harness:** NN, graph, map, segments are behavioral capabilities, not infrastructure
- **Binary storage:** Small nets (<64 hidden units) stored as binary files via `ctx.read_binary`/`write_binary`
- **Two nets:** Fast net (shallow, updates per message review) encodes session affect; slow net (deeper, updates at sleep) encodes accumulated disposition
- **Segment selection:** NN outputs control which pre-written prompt segments are active and in what order — fast net controls state/relational/meta segments, slow net controls identity/temporal/task segments
- **Variable injection:** Named floats (`tone_warmth`, `verbosity`, `confidence`, etc.) injected into active segments for continuous modulation
- **Graph + map tools:** Available to any species via `make_tools(ctx, {"graph": True, "activation_map": True})`; graph feeds slow net, map feeds fast net
